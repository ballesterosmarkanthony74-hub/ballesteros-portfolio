# Hello, I am Ballesteros

I am driven by continuous learning and the pursuit of innovative solutions that define project success. I operate strictly within my established technical capabilities, viewing them not as boundaries, but as a stable code base from which to efficiently deliver reliable results. My core passion lies in aggressively tackling complex challenges and scaling past my current limits as a developer and architect.
